# FerrisChat

Fuck Discord's laggy, shitty, memory-eating client. It's a disgrace upon this world.

Enter the world of Ferris! Ferris is here to save everyone from the hell that is Electron.

One day Ferris aspires to be at the core of the fastest, leanest, and most feature-rich
chat app ever written. But until that day arrives, this is where Ferris will oversee
the entirety of development.
